# Bricoleur
Bricoleur is a 3D printer designed to use clay or other paste materials.

This is a work in progress. It is based on pioneering work by Studio Unfold http://www.thingiverse.com/unfold/about , Jonathan Keep http://www.thingiverse.com/JKeep/about , the Wasp Group http://ow.ly/Zt2tz , and more. The project was initiated by Tom Lauerman http://www.tomlauerman.com/ at Penn State University, School of Visual Arts https://sova.psu.edu/ and is being developed in collaboration with Engineering Students as part of the University's Learning Factory program http://www.lf.psu.edu/ . The work is supported, in part, by Penn Stateâ€™s Center for Innovative Material Processing through Direct Digital Deposition (CIMP-3D, http://www.cimp-3d.org )
